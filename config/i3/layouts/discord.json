// Discord is here two times because it can't behave.
// The first time catches the placeholder window it creates, and the second
// catches the second window it creates. Why it creates and destroys a
// window during setup, I'll never understand. Worse, unlike steam, which
// has a separate login prompt with distinguishable attributes, the two
// Discord windows look the same as far as I can tell (given that they
// appear and disappear very quickly).
