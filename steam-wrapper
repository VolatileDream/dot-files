# Steam wrapper, because fossilize_replay is broken:
# https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Fossilize/issues/84
#
# This wrapper works by starting a fake steam game that we use to detect
# when steam is done starting. Once the fake game runs, we do our setup, and
# then normal steam things can happen.
#

#### SETUP ####
#
# To setup add `tools/steam-fake-game` to steam. It's important it keeps the
# name 'steam-fake-game'.
#
# Then in a terminal run:
# $ grep --recursive ~/.steam/steam/userdata/ --regexp steam-fake-game
# You should get something like this:
#
#                                               filename                   game id      steam game name
# /----------------------------------------------------|    /--------------------|    /---------------|
# ~/.steam/steam/userdata/<steamid>/760/screenshots.vdf:    "16201299119438823424"    "steam-fake-game"
#
# Replace the game id below with what you find.
#
####  END  ####
STEAM_GAME_ID=16201299119438823424 # REPLACE ME
